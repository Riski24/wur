There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Would U Rather ##
  > For playing would you rather with friends and family in an online environment.

## Summary ##
  > Friends and family can play would you rather online using user created questions. The results will be raw numbers with no personal
  information letting everyone answer as truthfully as they want. Groups can be created with invited users allowing for the ability to
  keep the questions asked and answered within your control.

## Problem ##
  > Inability to play would you rather in an anonymous manner online with a select group of people easily.

## Solution ##
  > Groups can be created to section off your specific questions and answers and all responses are provided anonymously so no one knows
  who said what.

## Quote from You ##
  > "I'm not sure what to do with my hands."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Once you create an account you can immediately create a group and invite all your participants. Anyone inside the group can create
  questions.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I can't believe most of my family would rather eat Taco Bell than my lasagna."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > It will be fun to get an idea on where members of your group stand on certain options and it will certainly bring up interesting
  conversations! Go out and make a group or two and start finding out how weird your friends and family really are.
